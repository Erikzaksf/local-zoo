# Seattle Zoo Caretaker Manager.

  This is a solo programming project for Epicodus that requires a Angular 2 web app that allows employees of the local Zoo keep track of caretakers and how many each animal requires, they must be able to add/edit animals as well as filter list results by age.

*Future functionality planned:*
  1. Get total Caretakers required per day.
  2. Elaborate on per day feature with ability to select by location and return number of caretakers assigned to that location,
  3. Add a scheduled feeding/upkeep field so eventually the ability to reduce overlap in on-clock caretakers can be eliminated with multiple animals going to a caretaker if their first animal doesn't require an entire shift of work.
  4. Add clock-in and clock-out notes to animal profiles, this way important information can be passed in the event of no face to face interaction between shift changes.
